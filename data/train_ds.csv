PRETOX_REL,"Cerebellum acetylcholinesterase activity increased 14 % and 11 % in the low dose males and females , respectively ."
PRETOX_REL,"Conclusions As the findings observed after the low and mid dose are either of minor biological relevance ( sialorrhea and decrease in locomotive activity , vomitus , slight and reversible decreases in parameters of red blood cells ) or explainable by the pharmacological action ( reversible morphological alterations at reproductive organs ) of the compound which interferes with the endocrine system of the dog , the dose of 15 mg / kg COMPOUND_XXX is regarded as NOAEL in respect of the future use in female breast cancer patients ."

NO_PRETOX_REL,Serum samples for toxicokinetic analysis were collected from all nonrecovery animals on days 1/2 and days 28/29 .
NO_PRETOX_REL,"Dose - linearity and changes of pharmacokinetic parameters with increasing treatment period were not assessed , since areas under the concentration - time curves could not be calculated ."
NO_PRETOX_REL,"However , all of the high dose animals showed signs of menstruation during the study , so that the physiologic function of the organ did not seem significantly impaired ."
NO_PRETOX_REL,Plasma blood glucose levels were determined in the toxicokinetic rats as a marker for the pharmacodynamic effect .
